# Out Of Office Design System

The design language is **"luxury travel editorial"** — restrained, elegant, atmospheric, and premium. Interfaces should feel calm, intentional, and high-end.

## Core Principles

- **Atmosphere-first**: Full-bleed imagery, layered overlays, and disciplined spacing over dense UI chrome.
- **Timeless typography**: Brand/logotype elements use Swear Display; all body/UI text uses Degular.
- **Neutral sophistication**: Warm off-whites, soft charcoals, muted bronze accents. Avoid loud saturation.
- **Minimal motion**: Smooth fades, subtle reveal, and gentle transitions. No jumpy micro-interaction noise.
- **Editorial hierarchy**: Clear visual rhythm from hero to detail sections, with generous whitespace.

## Typography

| Use | Font | Style |
|---|---|---|
| Logo / hero brand lockups | Swear Display | high contrast, elegant serif, moderate tracking |
| Headings | Degular (display weights) | clean sans with tight but breathable tracking |
| Body / labels / controls | Degular | medium regularity, highly legible |
| Meta / utility text | Degular | slightly increased letter spacing for clarity |

## Colour (CSS variables)

All colors should be defined as CSS variables and used through tokens. Avoid hardcoded component-level hex values. Keep contrast accessible while preserving a refined muted palette.

## Layout

- Hero sections can be full viewport height with layered overlays.
- Content sections should stay constrained and readable with clear vertical rhythm.
- Navigation should feel light and integrated over imagery (not boxed/heavy).
- Use thin rules, restrained card treatments, and generous breathing room.

## Components

- **Primary CTA**: Simple, premium button styling with subtle borders and clean hover states.
- **Nav links**: Underline/opacity emphasis, not loud color shifts.
- **Cards/panels**: Soft borders, low-contrast surfaces, minimal decorative clutter.
- **Media blocks**: Respect imagery; overlays should improve readability without flattening the image.

## What NOT to do

- No playful/neon palettes or loud gradients.
- No dense dashboards with cramped spacing and heavy boxes.
- No typography drift away from Swear Display (brand) + Degular (body/UI).
- No aggressive animation, bouncing transitions, or novelty effects.
- No inconsistent visual language between admin and front-end surfaces.
